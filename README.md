# Sexual Misconduct Programs of Public Transportation Agencies

## Background

The presentation here summarizes the results of independent qualitative research I conducted about sexual misconduct programs of public transportation agencies in The U.S.

I presented this research as my final project for the graduate-level course Transportation Policy (TTP 220) at UC Davis.

This study explores the response of U.S. public transportation agencies to sexual harassment and assault incidents that have taken place on board through sexual
misconduct programs case studies. These case studies provide insights into the tools transit operators can utilize for combatting sexual misconduct.

## Introduction

Sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment (unwanted sexual attention) and sexual assault (forced sexual acts), is widely spread on public transit in the U.S. 
Yet, this crime is heavily underreported. The fear of sexual misconduct victimization impacts the travel behavior of riders, and in particular, 
it impacts riders who identify as women.

In recent years we witness an increased awareness of sexual harassment and sexual assault crimes, tightened with the establishment and implementation of policies and programs
combatting those crimes. Additionally, in the past few years, we can find more and more transit agencies who are combining efforts with
local non-profit organizations supporting sexual violence victims to develop independent anti-sexual harassment and assault programs targeting transit riders.

While existing literature identifies tools that should be used by public transportation agencies for the sexual misconduct combat,
I learned that no prior research conducts a comprehensive case-based comparison review of different sexual misconduct programs of US transportation agencies.
